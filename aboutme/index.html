    <h3>Call me Alex (or whatever you feel like really)</h3>
    <p>I'm from a small town on the other side of the state called Parma. I'm 20, and this is my first semester here at BYU Idaho. I am studying Computer Science, and I'm excited to learn a TON. I hope to be able to take advantage of the huge demand for people with the skill sets I will learn here to be able to create a stable and comfortable life for the family I one day hope to raise.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life and very, very recently came home from my mission in Chile and California. After that wonderful experience, I am excited to continue to live by the principles in the favorite scripture (Alma 37:6), "by small and simple things are great things brought to pass". I also love things like Star Wars, Marvel, playing piano, eating, watching movies, etc.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to get to know my professor(s) and classmates during this semester, and I can't wait to keep learing. See you guys around</p>
